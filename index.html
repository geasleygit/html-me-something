        <p>If you want to climb a mountain, be prepared to spend a lot of time in a car. 
           Once you hit the Visitor's Center, it's all uphill from there. Rainier is majestic
           and incredibly accessible to the public. The wildlife is also quite friendly...</p>

        <p>Old Yurt McGurt served us well. If you get the opportunity to camp in a yurt, I highly recommend the experience. Also, say 'Yurt' as much as possible.</p>
