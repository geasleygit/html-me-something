        <h2>Acadia National Park</h2>
        <img src="Abrams Acadia.JPG" alt="Cadillac Mountain" class="center">
        <p>The first view of sunrise on the continental U.S. is from atop Cadillac Mountain in Maine. Check out that J.J. Abrams lens flare.</p>
        <img src="Bark Harbor.JPG" alt="Good Boy" class="center">
        <p>Bar Harbor is so dog friendly, it is known as Bark Harbor. Dog is not a professional model, just a very good boy.</p>
        <img src="Bridge.JPG" alt="Bridge" class="center">
        <p>There are several unique landmarks at Acadia National Park, some of them are even man made.</p>

        <h2>Pacific Northwest</h2>
        <img src="Rainier.JPG" alt="Mount Rainier" class="center">
        <p>If you want to climb a mountain, be prepared to spend a lot of time in a car. Once you hit the Visitor's Center, it's all uphill from there. Rainier is majestic and incredibly accessible to the public.</p>
        <img src="Chipmunk.jpg" alt="Alvin" class="center">
        <p>A normal chipmunk is a tiny little creature, Rainier chippers are twice the size and show up in a gang! It may seem cute that they eat trail mix right out of your hand, but they can take a chunk of flesh with it if you’re not careful!</p>
        <img src="Yurt.png" alt="Old Yurty Bastard" class="center">
        <p>Old Yurt McGurt served us well. If you get the opportunity to camp in a yurt, I highly recommend the experience. Also, say 'Yurt' as much as possible.</p>

        <h2>Iceland</h2>
        <img src="AB.jpg" alt="Aurora Borealis" class="center">
        <p>It's…hard to explain the Aurora Borealis. You hear about it or you maybe saw a picture of it once, but there is nothing quite like standing under that velvet sky, ignoring the frozen wind whipping around you as you try to grasp the sheer enormity of what you are witnessing. Your brain knows that you are seeing a disturbance in the magnetosphere, yet your heart sees only magic. </p>
        <img src="icehorse.jpg" alt="Norse Horse" class="center">
        <p>These little Viking horses are small but mighty. You have to slide your stomach onto the saddle, though, as their backs can’t handle Western-style mounting. </p>
        <img src="icemount.jpg" alt="Mountain" class="center">
        <p>This mountain is completely inaccesible during much of the year. It puts the 'Ice' in Iceland!</p>
